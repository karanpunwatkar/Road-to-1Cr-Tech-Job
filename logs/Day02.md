## ✅ What I Did Today

- 📘 **JavaScript Learning:**
  - Continued JS after basics: Covered functions, return types, scope
  - Practiced with examples and implemented small code snippets

- 🧠 **Problem Solving:**
  - Solved 2 JavaScript problems related to strings and functions
  - Attempted 1 LeetCode Medium question — took time, used YouTube guidance to understand and solve it fully

- 🛠️ **Career Prep & Applications:**
  - Explored and applied to coding competitions and hackathons via Unstop
  - Also applied to a few job/internship roles relevant to my track
