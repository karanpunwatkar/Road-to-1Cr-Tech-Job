## 🚀 Day 6 Log – June 11, 2025

### ✅ What I Did Today

- 📚 **Completed ~80% of JavaScript course** on CodeChef  
  > Covered major topics including variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, ES6+ basics.  
  Not mastered, but now confident with fundamentals needed for React and backend work.

- 🧑‍💻 **Met with my project team**  
  > Discussed roadmap and roles for the upcoming civic-tech project. Set expectations and planned collaboration flow.

- 🚀 **Submitted Hackathon Project on Unstop**  
  > Completed and submitted our project to an ongoing Hackathon. Focused on solving a real-world problem with a working prototype.

- 📹 **Worked briefly on my YouTube side content**  
  > Cleaned up drafts and brainstormed potential content ideas to share my roadmap publicly (as accountability + branding).

### 🧠 Reflections

- Felt good to be back in flow after a tough mental week.  
- JavaScript isn’t perfect yet — but it’s no longer scary.  
- Juggling project, hackathon, and learning is hard — but it’s preparing me for the startup environment I want to be in.
