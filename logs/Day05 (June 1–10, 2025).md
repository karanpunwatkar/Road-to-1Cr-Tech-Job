## 📘 Day 5 Log – (June 1–10, 2025)

### 🛑 Status: No Technical Progress This Week

### 🎉 1–5 June: Sister's Wedding
Took a complete break from learning to fully celebrate my sister’s wedding. Family time, travel, and all the rituals were absolutely worth it. No regrets.

### 😔 6–10 June: Mental Block & Self-Doubt

- Returned to my learning plan but got overwhelmed.
- Started comparing myself with others, questioning my ability to crack a ₹1Cr+ package.
- Felt stuck and cried a lot. Spent days overthinking whether this roadmap, my background, or my skills were enough.
- Thought of quitting — but didn’t.

### 💭 What I Realized

- Taking breaks is **not failure**, it’s part of the journey.
- My doubts are **not a signal to stop**, they’re a reminder to reflect, slow down, and realign.
- I don’t need to know everything today — just need to keep **moving one day at a time**.

### 🔁 Recovery Plan
- Restart from **Day 6**, no guilt, no rush.
- Pick up from where I left off: **React useState + Events**
- Rebuild my belief one small win at a time.
