## 📘 Day 20 Log – June 25, 2025

### ✅ What I Did Today

- ⏰ **Woke Up Early**
  - Started the day early despite feeling slightly unwell and low on energy.

- 👨‍💻 **Light Project Work + Learning**
  - Worked briefly on ongoing projects.
  - Explored new **hackathons and Unstop competitions** — reviewed themes, guidelines, and timelines.
  - Studied programming concepts at a light pace to keep the habit alive.

- 🧠 **Rest and Light Recovery Mode**
  - Felt a bit lazy and under the weather — chose to not push too hard today.
  - Took breaks and allowed time to recharge mentally and physically.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Evening Student Session (7:00 PM – 9:00 PM)**
  - Conducted a full **2-hour class** for students, staying committed to teaching even while unwell.
  - Covered key concepts and helped students with doubt-solving and post-test review.

- 🛌 **Early Sleep**
  - Prioritized rest and recovery to bounce back stronger for the next day.

### 🧠 Reflections
