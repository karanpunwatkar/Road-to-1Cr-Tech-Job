### 🧠 Reflections

- Not getting selected in the hackathon stung a little, but it's part of the journey — every failure is feedback.
- Happy with student test execution and my ability to manage technical + academic + content roles.
- YouTube slow phase is temporary — it's about consistency, not just views.
