# 🚀 6-Month Journey to ₹1 Crore Package (May–Nov 2025)

Welcome to the documentation of my intense, focused, and consistent 6-month journey — where I aim to transform from a freshly graduated non-CS student into a full-stack developer and problem solver capable of cracking high-paying tech roles at top startups.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To prepare rigorously and crack a ₹1 Crore+ software engineering role (or equivalent) by:
- 🚀 Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- 🧠 Building strong problem-solving speed and logic
- 🌐 Gaining full-stack development skills
- 🛠️ Creating real-world, production-ready projects
- 💼 Becoming job-ready for high-growth startups & global tech companies

This is not just about the final result — it's about giving my **101%** every single day, regardless of the outcome.

## 🗓️ Timeline

- **Start Date:** May 28, 2025  
- **End Date:** November 30, 2025  
- **Daily Commitment:** Minimum 8–10 hours of learning, coding, and building  
- **Mode:** Self-study, self-discipline, no coaching
